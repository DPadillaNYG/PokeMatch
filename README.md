# PokéMatch

PokéMatch is a compatibility-based application, sort of like those trivia websites that determine which movie character you are based on a series of questions. This is my first full-stack individual project using both Node.js and Express. The application works off of answers given to the server by the user, which will then be compared to answers of pre-existing pokemon within /api/pokemon. The application will then conclude by displaying the name and picture of the pokemon with the best overall match.

Express is used to handle routing and deployed through Heroku for free server support.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife who is also a very talented programmer and Stack Overflow. Here are some things I learned and integrated into this project:

- express (npm package) _for server setup_
- express middleware
- path _built-in Node package_
- forEach Loops
- \$.post() _jQuery POST method_
- res.send(), res.json(), res.sendFile()

### Comments

The biggest challenge was solving the logic behind the match-based system. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working with Express as well as getting better at making sense of multiple folders of files.
